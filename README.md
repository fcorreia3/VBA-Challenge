# VBA-Challenge

# I send my code in Slack this weekend because I was having an error with the division (due to 
# having a denominator equal to zero) even when I filter zeros out before doing that division. 

# Yesterday, I wanted to show you the error, but when I ran my code to Ju it ran fine. Now it is 
# returning the same error, but I am submitting it like it is. I would very much appreciate your feedback 
# and know what is causing the error.

# Thank you.
